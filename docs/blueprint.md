## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to establish a modern and trustworthy feel.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F2F5) for the light theme, allowing tools to stand out. Dark variant for dark mode.
- Accent color: Violet (#7952B3), used selectively for interactive elements, complemented with orange (#FF9800) for the orange theme, and light blue for the blue wavy theme, adapting as required.
- Body font: 'Inter', a sans-serif, selected for its clean appearance and readability across devices; suitable for body text and headlines
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro', a monospaced font that complements 'Inter'; ensures code snippets in the toolbox appear clear and structured.
- Simple, outline-style icons for different tools and categories. Icons change according to the selected theme (light, dark, blue wavy, or orange).
- Responsive layout based on a grid system that adapts to various screen sizes. Clean, uncluttered design with generous whitespace.
